                "A brown beret failed to hide his long hair. A stained rag was his substitute for a top. His dress shoes were immaculate though."
                "At the age of seven, he was approached by a well-mannered barber, who pitied him and offered him a \"simple\" part-time job.\n"

                "The victim was knocked unconscious with the psychoactive drug Benzodiazepines and then operated on. The boy helped with\n"

                "If that's not enough, the debt would finally die. That's not the solution though. A life of debt called for no end of constant pestering and no pleasantries.\n"
                "As Arata's mother tried to chip at her debt with odd jobs, Arata was passionately trying to be a surgeon.\n"
