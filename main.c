CURRENT GOALS:
P. Make sure that the stack isn't very full                                                         <<<
1. Finish the "Battle Royale Island" event.                                                         <<
    a. Designing and implementing POLITICIAN's drop item.                                           <<<
        - Pot of milk from the cosmic Ocean of Milk (from Vishnu's myth)
        - Use #1: RIVALED (versatility makes this item have less uses and an additional karma cost)
        - Use #2: SPIKES
    b. Verifying that moving through the LOBBY, JUNGLE, and CLIFF works (loops through them).       <<<
    c. Implement the prizes for winning the event.                                                  <<<
    d. Make it so that after claiming your prize, return to the initial MAP.                        <<<
    e. Add descriptors to the dialogue (what is going on/setting)                                   <<
1.5. Convenient fixes
    a. Implement PRIORITY for more convenient nested move_char()                                    <<<
    b. Easier/more efficient way to set tile symbols                                                <<
2. Design the next map.                                                                             <

    b. POLICE character.                                                                            <
        i. Storyline & dialogue                                                                     <

3. Rework the JUDGE character                                                                       <
4. Brainstorm the fates of each character depending on options chosen                               <
5. Implement ending screen (iterate through each fate)                                              <
